To play the game, open a command line interface and change the working directory to the directory where 
Reversi.py is saved. Then run 'python reversi.py'. The user will play as the black pieces and the AI will play
as the white pieces. Instructions for how to play will appear at the beginning of the game. The depth of
minimax search can be easily changed by changing the value of the global variable depth at the top of 
reversi.py.
